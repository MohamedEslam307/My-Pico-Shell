# Task5-Enhanced-Pico-Shell
Enhancing my Pico Shell with built-in echo, pwd, cd, and exit commands. It parses user input, dynamically allocates memory for flexible arguments, and executes commands using fork/exec. Enjoy direct program execution without the full path requirement. i also impelemnted I/O redirection for enhanced functionality.
